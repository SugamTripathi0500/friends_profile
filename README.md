# Friends Profile Website

Welcome to the **Friends Profile Website** repository! This project was initially created for fun during our first year of college. The website showcases profiles of friends and includes dynamic features built with HTML and CSS.

## Overview

The Friends Profile Website is a dynamic site that we developed purely for enjoyment. To share the fun with others, we hosted the website for a year using the free GitHub hosting provided by our college.

### Features

- **Dynamic Content**: Despite being built with HTML and CSS, the site includes dynamic elements to enhance the user experience.
- **Profile Showcase**: Each friend's profile is displayed with personal details and fun facts.
- **CSS Styling**: The site is visually appealing, thanks to custom CSS styles.

## Getting Started

## Hosting

The site was originally hosted for a year using the free GitHub hosting provided by our college. To host the site yourself, you can use GitHub Pages or any other static site hosting service.
